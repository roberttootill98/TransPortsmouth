# TransPortsmouth
INSE

Getting the server on your VM:
go into the VM and type 'git clone' then copy and paste the github directory link it will look like this:
git clone https://github.com/roberttootill98/TransPortsmouth 

This is create a directory called 'TransPortsmouth' within the directory there will be all the files from GitHub.

To update this directory in your VM, type 'git pull'.

To start the system:
cd into the directory: cd TransPortsmouth
then you type 'node server/server'
Doing this will now start the server. To connect to the server go to the IP on your VM.

To run the tests there are two functions; if you are on index.html then run 'test()' in the console, and if you are on review.html then run 'reviewTest()' in the console. 

For tests that fail, errors may appear in the console, but if 'All Tests Pass' appears it is still functioning correctly.
